# hello-world

It doesn't have much going on these days.
Which is why I decided a new career taking
On this coding thing pretty seriously. A
Little slow on the update but I got this.
I'm like to go surfing and dirtbike riding.
But I'm getting pretty old, so the whole
physical sports is getting gruff.

Always want to learn how to make computers work.
So, it's off to my new career.

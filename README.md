# hello-world

It doesn't have much going on these days.
Which is why I decided a new career taking
on this coding thing pretty seriously. A
little slow on the update but I got this. I'm
going to go surfing dirtbike riding. I'm
getting pretty old, so the whole physical sports
is getting gruff.

Always want to learn how to make computers work.
Do, it's off to my new career.

Also I'm not much for nicities but I have been
improving.
